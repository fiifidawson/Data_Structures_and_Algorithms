Stacks and queues are elegant tools for handling temporary data.

## Stacks
LIFO Last In First Out:this means is that the last item pushed onto astack is always the first item popped from it.
A stack stores data in the same way arrays do. It has three constraints.
• Data can be inserted only at the end of a stack.
• Data can be deleted only from the end of a stack.
• Only the last element of a stack can be read.

most computer science literature refers to the end of the stack as its top, and the beginning of the stack as its bottom.

Inserting a new value into a stack is also called pushing onto the stack.
Removing elements from the top of the stack is called popping from the stack.
