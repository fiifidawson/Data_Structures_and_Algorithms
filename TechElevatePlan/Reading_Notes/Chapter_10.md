Recursion is the term for a function calling itself.
Recursion is a tool that allows for writing elegant code.

## Recursion
Base case are normally introduced in recursive codes to serve as the limit or break points.

## The Call Stack
The computer uses a stack to keep track of which functions it’s in the middle of calling.

## Stack Overflow
The call stack grows and grows until, eventually, the computer reaches a point where there’s simply no more room in its short-term memory to hold all this data. This causes an error known as stack overflow.

## Filesystem Traversal
One type of problem in which recursion is a natural fit is when we need to delve into multiple layers of a problem without knowing how many layers there are.
