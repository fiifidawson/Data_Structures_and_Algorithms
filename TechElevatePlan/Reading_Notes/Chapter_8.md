## Hash Map
Extremely fast look ups. O(1)
Other names include hashes, maps, hash maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays.

A hash table is a list of paired values. The first item in each pair is called the key, and the second item is called the value.

HashTable = {Key/Index: Value}

Looking up a value in a hash table has an efficiency of O(1) on average, 2as it usually takes just one step.

## Hashing and Hash Function
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5

The process of taking characters and converting them to numbers is known as hashing.

The code that is used to convert those letters into particular numbers is called a hash function.

Placement of a value is determined by its key.

Unordered Array = O(N)
Ordered Array = O(logN)
